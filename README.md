# Various-visualisation-set-up-in-R
This repo will update some commands and methods to visualise different types of data for various purposes in R. 
Visualisation or graphical data analysis has been a long established topic in statistics and data science due to its importance in extracting underlying patterns of data that may be masked by numeric model performance metrics or parameter values. 
However, most courses offering guidance on data visualisation only focus on particular data type, while there is increasing tendency from analysing traditional cross-sectional data to high-dimensional data, time series data, spatial/geospatial data and spatio-temporal data (netcdf) data.
This repo aims to summarise how we can come about analysing different data types graphically and produce visually appealing graphs in a more efficient way in R, using different packages, functions and graphic set-up schemes.
In other words, the repo does not focus on creating new features or packages for visualisation, but just provides a workbook that can be referred to from time to time.
